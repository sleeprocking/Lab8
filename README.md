##Description
This code allows the DFEC robot to navigate a maze autonomously by utilizing the libraries from Labs 6 and 7, which are the motor movement driver and the IR sensor driver. This code design utilizes the front and left sensors to navigate the maze by following the left wall. This code achieves A and bonus funtionality as it can reach the last door of the maze and find its was back to the start without touching any walls. 
##Documentation
I received help on the driver libraries in past labs. All code written in this lab was created without help other than recommendations by Capt Branchflower.
